This is the place where I, **JoubaMety**, store my public notes, code snippets and such.

What inspired me to start this was that I was often finding myself scrolling through console history or browser history, searching for how to use specific video filter in `ffmpeg`.<br>
I also help some people with `ffmpeg`, so having a place which I can just link to other people, with better info rather than remembering from head, which can be sometimes treacherous or even dangerous.<br>

Here are the main tags, where you can find notes under:
- [[/tags/video|Video]] - Here, you can find stuff related to creating or transcoding videos
