**FFmpeg** is a [free and open-source software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software "Free and open-source software") project consisting of a suite of [libraries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing) "Library (computing)") and [programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program "Computer program") for handling video, audio, and other [multimedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia "Multimedia") files and streams. At its core is the [command-line](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface "Command-line interface") `ffmpeg` tool itself, designed for processing of video and audio files. It is widely used for format [transcoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transcoding "Transcoding"), basic editing (trimming and [concatenation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concatenation "Concatenation")), [video scaling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_scaler "Video scaler"), video [post-production](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-production "Post-production") effects and standards compliance ([SMPTE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Society_of_Motion_Picture_and_Television_Engineers "Society of Motion Picture and Television Engineers"), [ITU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Telecommunication_Union "International Telecommunication Union")).

FFmpeg also includes other tools: `ffplay`, a simple media player and [[FFprobe|ffprobe]], a command-line tool to display media information. Among included libraries are [libavcodec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libavcodec "Libavcodec"), an audio/video [codec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Codec "Codec") library used by many commercial and free software products, **libavformat** (Lavf),[8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg#cite_note-Lavf-8) an audio/video [container](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Container_format_(computing) "Container format (computing)") [mux and demux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiplexing "Multiplexing") library, and libavfilter, a library for enhancing and editing filters through a [Gstreamer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gstreamer "Gstreamer")-like filtergraph.[9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg#cite_note-9)

FFmpeg is part of the workflow of many other software projects, and its libraries are a core part of software media players such as [VLC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VLC_media_player "VLC media player"), and has been included in core processing for [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YouTube "YouTube") and [Bilibili](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilibili "Bilibili").[10](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg#cite_note-10) Encoders and decoders for many audio and video file formats are included, making it highly useful for the transcoding of common and uncommon media files.
