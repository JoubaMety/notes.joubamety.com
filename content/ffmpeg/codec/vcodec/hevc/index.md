**High Efficiency Video Coding** (**HEVC**), also known as **H.265** and **MPEG-H Part 2**, is a [video compression standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_coding_format "Video coding format") / [[ffmpeg/codec/vcodec/index|video coding format]] designed as part of the [MPEG-H](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-H "MPEG-H") project as a successor to the widely used [[ffmpeg/codec/vcodec/avc/index|Advanced Video Coding]] (AVC, H.264, or [MPEG-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4 "MPEG-4") Part 10). In comparison to AVC, HEVC offers from 25% to 50% better [data compression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_compression "Data compression") at the same level of [video quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Video_quality "Video quality"), or substantially improved video quality at the same [bit rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_rate "Bit rate"). It supports resolutions up to 8192×4320, including [8K UHD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ultra-high-definition_television "Ultra-high-definition television"), and unlike the primarily 8-bit AVC, HEVC's higher fidelity Main 10 profile has been incorporated into nearly all supporting hardware.

While [[ffmpeg/codec/vcodec/avc/index|AVC]] uses the integer [discrete cosine transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_cosine_transform "Discrete cosine transform") (DCT) with 4×4 and 8×8 block sizes, HEVC uses both integer DCT and [discrete sine transform](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_sine_transform "Discrete sine transform") (DST) with varied block sizes between 4×4 and 32×32. The [High Efficiency Image Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format "High Efficiency Image File Format") (HEIF) is based on HEVC.[2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding#cite_note-apple-2)
